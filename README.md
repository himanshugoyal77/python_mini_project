# Django Auth System

Django is a popular and powerful web framework for Python that comes with a built-in authentication system. This authentication system provides secure login and registration functionality for web applications, and is highly customizable to suit the needs of any project.

The Django auth system allows users to create accounts, log in, log out, and reset their passwords. It also provides a range of features such as user permissions, groups, and authentication middleware that can be used to control access to specific areas of the application.
